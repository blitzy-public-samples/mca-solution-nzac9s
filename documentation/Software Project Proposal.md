### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

1. OCR Technology Performance:
   - Risk: The performance of the OCR technology may require additional fine-tuning or a switch to a more advanced solution.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated a substantial budget for OCR licensing and included contingency funds. If needed, we can reallocate resources or extend the development timeline to ensure optimal performance.

2. Cloud Infrastructure Costs:
   - Risk: Actual usage may exceed or fall below the estimated annual cloud services cost.
   - Mitigation: We will implement cloud cost monitoring tools and provide monthly reports to the client. The contract will include provisions for adjusting the ongoing cloud services budget based on actual usage.

3. Scope Creep:
   - Risk: Additional features or requirements may be identified during development, potentially impacting the budget.
   - Mitigation: We have included a 10% contingency fund. Any significant changes to the scope will be addressed through a formal change request process, with associated costs clearly communicated to the client.

4. Integration Challenges:
   - Risk: Unforeseen difficulties in integrating with Dollar Funding's existing systems could increase development time and costs.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated ample time for API development and testing. If major integration issues arise, we will work closely with Dollar Funding's IT team to resolve them, potentially using part of the contingency budget if necessary.

5. Security and Compliance:
   - Risk: Changes in data protection regulations or additional security requirements could impact the project timeline and budget.
   - Mitigation: We have included a dedicated budget for security audits and compliance. Our team will stay informed about relevant regulations and adapt our approach as needed, using the contingency fund if required.

6. Exchange Rate Fluctuations:
   - Risk: If any project components involve international vendors or services, exchange rate changes could affect costs.
   - Mitigation: Where applicable, we will use forward contracts or include provisions in the client contract to address potential currency fluctuations.

7. Staffing Changes:
   - Risk: Unexpected changes in key personnel could impact project timelines and potentially the budget.
   - Mitigation: Our agency maintains a deep bench of skilled professionals. We have included knowledge transfer processes in our project management approach to minimize the impact of any staffing changes.

By carefully considering these budget factors and implementing the proposed mitigation strategies, we aim to deliver the project within the estimated budget while maintaining flexibility to address unforeseen challenges.
