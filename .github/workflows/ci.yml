# HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED
# Please review the following:
# 1. Ensure that the paths to backend and frontend directories are correct.
# 2. Verify that the commands for running tests, linting, and building are aligned with the project's setup.
# 3. Confirm that the artifact paths for test results and build artifacts are accurate.
